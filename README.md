## API

Click this link [API songs](https://apisongsface.herokuapp.com/)

## Objective

Nowadays, we have access to an unlimited number of songs of all possible types. Many times, with so much possibility, we do not know where to choose.

Depending on the day, the moment, or our mood, we decided between thousands of songs.

For the days where it is difficult to decide, you can use this API. Upload a photo and, depending on your mood, the API will recommend you a song for your mood.
